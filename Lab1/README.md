Anaconda Distribution: Successfully installed the Anaconda navigator to manage virtual environments and packages efficiently.

Integrated Development Environment (IDE): Deployed Visual Studio Code (VS Code) as the primary editor for writing and executing Python scripts.

2. Python Environment Setup
Interpreter Configuration: Linked the VS Code environment with the Anaconda Python interpreter to ensure seamless code execution.

Package Management: Verified the availability of essential data science libraries including pandas for data manipulation, numpy for numerical computing, and matplotlib for visualization.

3. Version Control Integration
GitHub Repository: Created and initialized a dedicated repository to host all machine learning lab assignments.

Local-Remote Sync: Configured Git credentials and established a connection between the local machine and the GitHub cloud repository.
